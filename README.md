nginx-portable
==============

nginx-portable is a portable version of the nginx web server for linux.  
At this point in time the package contains nginx-1.16.1 or nginx-1.17.9 with the --latest flag; so no fastcgi and mysql just yet.

#### About nginx

> nginx [engine x] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, as well as a mail proxy server, written by Igor Sysoev  

You can read all about it on the [nginx website](http://nginx.org/en/)  

## Goals
What is nginx-portable all about?
* A standalone, pre-configured, portable, stable version of the nginx web server for linux
* Easily distributable package together with or as base for other products

## Dependencies
On Ubuntu installing the following packages should provide all the files necessary to build nginx
```
sudo apt-get install curl build-essential libpcre3-dev libssl-dev
```

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository
2. To compile a binary for your architecture issue `./compile`.
3. Run `sudo ./nginx-portable start` to start the server
4. Fire up your favorite browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`
Voila!

Congratulations, your nginx server is up and running.  
Now go on and add your own files to the `html` directory.

## Usage

#### The init script
The init script works pretty much exactly like nginx init.d script on Ubuntu.
```
Usage: ./nginx-portable {start|stop|restart|reload|test}
```

#### Configuration
If you need to change any of the default values you can find `nginx.conf` under
`conf/nginx.conf` in the nginx-portable directory.

### Customization
Additional modules and flags can be added to/removed from the appropriate line in the `compile` file.

## Known issues
* This package has only been tested on Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS 32bit, Ubuntu Server 13.10 64bit and Ubuntu Server 14.04 64bit.
* The compile script currently does not work correctly under Mac OSX. You can get it to run by hardcoding the scripts absolute path to `BASEDIR` in the compile script.

If your find any bugs or have suggestions on how to improve nginx-portable, feel free to write up an issue here on GitHub or fork the repo to tinker with it yourself.
